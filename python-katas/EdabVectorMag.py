# You will be implementing a basic case of the map-reduce pattern in programming.
# Given a vector stored as a list of integers, find the magnitude of the vector.
# Use the standard distance formula for n-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.
# The list can have any length.
# The input list will contain integers (except for empty list [] âžž 0).

def magnitude(lst):


print(magnitude([3, 4])) # 5

print(magnitude([0, 0, -10])) # 10

print(magnitude([])) # 0

print(magnitude([2, 3, 6, 1, 8] )) # 10.677078252031311
