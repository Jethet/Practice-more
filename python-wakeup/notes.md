Python has five standard data types:
* Numbers
* String
* List
* Tuple
* Dictionary


The divmod() method takes two parameters x and y, where x is treated as numerator and y is treated as the denominator. The method calculates both x / y and x % y and returns both the values:
Input : x = 9, y = 3
Output :(3, 0)

Input : x = 8, y = 3
Output :(2, 2)


**Indexing:**  
Works forwards and backwards:  
P | Y | T | H | O | N 
--|---|---|---|---|--
0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
-6 | -5| -4 | -3 | -2 | -1

**Error handling in Python**  
The main distinguishable error types are:
* syntax errors (= parsing errors) are the most common
* exceptions: errors detected while executing

**Modules in Python**  
You can write a (long) program and save it as a module. This is known as creating a script. Modules can be imported across modules/applications to re re-used.

Creating one function to be repeated in a project as a module means that you only have to debug one function in case of an error: the function in that module.
